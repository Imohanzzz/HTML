                    <h2>Ah Quan</h2>
                    <p>Redtooth, formerly known as Ah Quan (阿权), is the main antagonist of Scissor Seven (刺客伍六七) in
                        Season 2 and a posthumous antagonist in Season 3. He’s one of the seven Shadow Assassins of
                        Xuanwu. He is possessed by the Blood Demon that gives him his powers. He had history with
                        Chairman Jiang.
                        edtooth has a shade of mint green hair and thin crimson red eyes showing the blood demon within.
                        He wears golden hoop earrings and a gold ankle bracelet. He also wears a blue scarf to cover his
                        mouth. He has an angled face that comes down to a slope, and a thin figure. His fingernails are
                        pointed at the tips and painted in what seems to be either a shade of black or very dark green.
                        When he is transformed, he becomes more unhinged, gaining faded lime green skin color, his teeth
                        become sharper gaining an even more blood-red color (hence his killer name). While his pupils
                        still have a crimson red color, his eyes turn entirely black, and became slightly more thin.

                    <h2>Manjusaka</h2>
                    <p>Manjusaka is an antagonist in Scissor Seven introduced in Season 3. She is a member of the Shadow
                        Killers.
                        Manjusaka appears to fall in love easily since she claims affection for many people such as
                        Black Bird, Green Phoenix and Seven. However, she can also be possessive of the people she
                        likes. She became jealous of the Girl In White that Seven was close to, and killed her after he
                        disappeared. She also tries to kill Seven, since he never returned her feelings and she didn't
                        want him to be with somebody else that isn't her. She seems to enjoy beautiful things, to the
                        point of calling Xiao Fei's transformed muscular appearance ugly. She also claims that she
                        dislikes being violent, but is able to fight hand-to-hand using her metal fan as a knife.
